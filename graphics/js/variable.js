Specifically, thegame is designed so that without the special item, participants have a 50% chance of winning the game. Participants are not directly told this, but should beable to infer it from the description of the game. We ask participants what the probability of winning the game without the special item is, and considerthose who respond with 50% as having understood the game. We will report results both for all participants and for only those who pass thecomprehension test."
